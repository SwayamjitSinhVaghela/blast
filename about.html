            <p>So, from where should I start this.... Well I'll tell you one thing and I know that this can either destory our everything or make.
                But the thing is I sort of do not feel fair to keep this in my head and heart like it had to be said or maybe it would get too late or idk wtf am I saying right now.
                I know this should not even be the thing after what I've done and I do. I really do not deserve any chance what so ever but I just didn't wanted any regrets and just wanted to express this.
                Like from past many days we've been talking and having good time idk about you but I really really enjoy every single text of yours and you are pretty much known to everything in my head just this one thing that..... I miss you.
                Ugh the thing is.... I miss you too much like how to put this I'm out of words. Remember I and that friend of mine talking about you for like eight hours. I was there just bragging about how good you really were and how bad I messed up.
                This might sound like I'm doing this because I'm all alone and stuff but thats completely not true. After we broke up I just idk I always wanted to. It was just a misunderstanding and that ruined everything and I regret that I didn't tried to save our relationship cause I thought you made up your mind and that was probably my thousandth mistake or something.
                Kept asking for chances while we were in and you gave me chances. Just didn't wanted to break your heart. I really don't know when are you going to see this thing I'm doing but I'll make sure it will be on 20th May you know what happened then or 30th April. When I first texted you. Let me tell you something.
                You have always been the girl of my dream. Like freaking always and you did everything I ever wanted. I admire you, you pushed me to achieve great things and lot of other stuff. Infact I started many of extra stuff like improving on football and bodybuilding and nature developement and stuff to become a better version of myself which you would never regret choosing.
                I hope you already figured out what this is about. I'm in love with you from over a year. I know this does not sound right and you might think that going back to your ex might be your worst decision and usually people think that and if they go things mess up even harshit told me not to do this but TRUST ME... We can make this work if we are willing to.
                We share a crazy bond like I never felt this attached to any other girl in this world neither even a guy our bond is quite unique we can make this work if you want to give me a chance.
                I can assure you if you say yes I'll fix everything. People say if you are going to your ex you don't love them you love the memories and stuff but that kind of is true if you take case of mine and someone pervious. But for you this isn't the case.
                We've shared so little time together we didn't created enough memeories I'm all into you not memories. I am not at all trust worthy in your sights anymore I totally know that but give me on last shot.
                I'm just a dumb fuck idiot who loves you. I really still think that I shouldn't have said any of this this might destory everything so I just wanna beg to you that whatever your answer is please don't dumb me please please please.
                I'm probably the most idiot guy you ever came across but I really do not know anything. If you're reading this idk how I even gathered up the courage to send this to you. This message is written on 24th of decemeber and tomarrow is Christmas I hope I'll not get screwed from what I wrote in that but waiting to see your reaction.
                Present time date is 18th Feb. I'd like to talk more. Lets end the sad part lets bring the boondmoshi in. Tera gulaab jaise khilal baadu. I can be your first call if you ever need one. I'll be your coffee pot. The thing is...... I just wanna be yours.
                Not into too much romance 'yet' jk I can do it now if you want me to. I can be a demond behind your back if you be my keiani I'll be your Sam if you be my Geo I'll be your cristiano and bring the world down for ya.
                I know you doubt it but you won't later I'm pretty damn sure. You know october mai mere matches h. I need a good relaxation, and for that I'll need your pics. I need a good post workout. I need a life supporting me on my deadlifts. I need a good foot support for amazing footwork while boxing.
                This Peter won't ever be a spiderman without a Gwen. In all universe Gwen Stacy and Spiderman get together, in everyother universe it doesn't end well. I guess there's first time for everything. Dude imagine taking a mirror selife and a two veins arms come from your back looking like wings to protect you. Imagineeeeeeeeeeeeee.
                Well all this aside I know you have other great dudes and I don't stand no where near anyone lmfao but I can assure you no will love you as selflessly as this mf. I've changed I didn't knew how to express my love back then but now I do you'll never feel alone just give me a try.
                I'll be your Mcgregor if you be my Dee Devil. Sure I cannot match to other people right now but I'm not stopping to improve I'll eventually be there.
                You know success is a journey and I want someone on my shoulders whom I can carry throught my joruney after that even the spikes and harsh roads of the journey will feel like a garden to me. I'm not a great writer neither a decent one I don't know even if I made sense in some lines but in a nutshell.
                I want you so bad I'm fuckin desprate. I love you Swasti in everyway. I've mentioned you in my prayers and always contiune to I also want to be with you in your and be a part of your success. I'll be there with you in every single up and down and trust me I can be really clingy.
                Sorry if you didn't liked anything I said but I'm just confessing whats in my mind. I know it's 12th and you might say no because of that and there could be many reason. Trust I would become a distraction in your studies infact we'll study together we can do great stuff and make study fun we'll score shit tons of marks together I know how to make this happen trust me. I'm still forgetting a lot of things I wanted to tell I'll keep adding them by time.
                20th of Feb. Something really happened. Two things has happened and one is related to us. Amyel is dying I'll litreally kill him.
                What happened was I and vedant were discussing what really happened while we both were not talking at all. Before that I Amyel and everyone aren't talking at all and the reason is Amyel is trying to make us all fight he speaks on every side he back bitches me in front of shubham and shubham and shubham is front of me and all that sort of stuff same he did with ishika and me andddd... 
                while we were not talking me and vedant he did the same he back bitched me and stuff and that I realised now. Vedant told me he wanted to me to go with kasturi and he tried to break us up when that raghav misunderstanding happened he told me she's a red flag and stuff. I really do not know how much will you believe this but Can I you and vedant have whatsapp group call to clear this thing out.
                I talked to vedant about many feelings I holded ever since and he told me to just confess them but I can't gather up the courage as I think you still hate me and you won't believe all this either.
                Keeping that apart. I hope you understand what has really happened and I'll be waiting for a call. Read futher
